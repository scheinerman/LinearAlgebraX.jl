# Extras for `LinearAlgebraX`

## Projective planes

The file `projective.jl` contains code for creating structures related 
to finite projective planes of prime order.

* `generate_points(p)` generates a list of the homogeneous coordinates of the 
points (lines) of a finite projective plane of prime order `p`.
* `incidence_matrix(p)` generates the point-line incidence matrix of a 
projective plane of order `p`.
* `incidence_graph(p)` generates the bipartite point-line incidence graph 
of a finite projective plane of order `p`.
* `incidence_hypergraph(p)` generates a hypergraph whose vertices are the 
points of an order-`p` projective plane and whose hyperedges are the lines 
of that plane.

## Old permanent code

The permanent of a matrix is now computed with a much more efficient method. The old code
is archived in the file `old_permanent.jl`.
